## üöÄ Performance Optimization

AnyDoc2PDF is meticulously optimized for performance in several ways:

- **Lazy Loading**: Components and libraries are loaded only when needed
- **Code Splitting**: The application is split into smaller chunks for faster loading
- **Optimized Assets**: Images and animations are optimized for web delivery
